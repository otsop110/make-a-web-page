          <p>After the first unit we are familiar with concepts such the web, html, urls and web applications. We know how I, my computer (browser), the internet, http and servers are connected to each other. We are also familiar with  basic html markups. We have learned how to edit text and how to add images and urls to our website.
          </P>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
         <ul>
          <li>is made of text content (what you see)</li>
				  <li>markup (what it looks like</li>
				  <li>references to other documents (for example images and videos</li>
				  <li>links to other pages</li>
		    </ul>
		  <h3>HTML markup</h3>
				<p>One element consists of an opening tag, contents and a closing tag.
		    </p>
			<h3>HTML attribute</h3>
			 	<p>consists of tag attr=value, contents and closing tag. A good example is a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML">hyperlink</a>.
 		    </p>
      <h3>Images</h3>
        <div class=image>     
				    <img src="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/283048/283048,1284913689,1/stock-photo-very-happy-black-dog-sitting-on-green-grass-61283164.jpg." alt="happy black dog sitting on a grass">
			 </div>
  		  <p>Images don't have closing tag.
  		  </p>
      <h3>White space</h3>
 			  <p>Text can be folded in multiple lines with break and paragraph tags.
 	     </p>
      <h3>Inline vs.block</h3>
 			  <p>br, img, span and a are inline elements. p, div are block elements.
          </p>

    After the stage 1 we know that web pages are constructed of boxes. HTML provides the structure to the website and CSS it`s style. Javascript provides interaction to the site. We are familiar with the concepts such as DOM (document object model) which provides the tree-like structure of the website. We also know that developers boxify their design. 
      </P>
    <h3>Html, CSS and Javascript</h3>
      <p>Html, CSS and Javascript are all languages. Html defines the structure of your document, CSS it`s style (how the page looks like) and Javascript it`s functionalities.
      </p>
    <h3>Boxes and Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
      <p>All elements on the website are boxes and each website has a tree like structure (DOM). The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. This relationship can be compared to a family tree. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. hen you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
      </p>
    <h3>Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
      <p>Writing code is easier with the special text editor such as Sublime. Text editors predict the tags we might want to use from the first letter and add a closing tag automatically.
      </p>
    <h3>CSS language</h3>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It allows programmers to avoid repetition. Order matters in CSS and most specific rule applies. Rules can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order: definitions further down on the list overwrite previous ones.
      </p>
   <h3>Code, test, refine</h3>
      <p>Look for natural boxes, repeated styles and semantic elements. Then write your html. Apply the styles from biggest to smallest. Fix things.
      </p>
    <h3>Developer tools</h3>
      <p>Developer tools allow us to test changes without applying them to html. They help us to compare our code with the design mock-up. We can compare margins, color etc.
      </p>  
    <h3>Validate your code</h3>
        <p>Verify your html and css with the validator tools.<br>To verify HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a><br>
To verify CSS: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input</a>
